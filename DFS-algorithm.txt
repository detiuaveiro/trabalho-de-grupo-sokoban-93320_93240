Depth First Search Algorithm

stack ← starting position of Sokoban
depth ← 1 while stack is not empty do
       if Are crates on target then
              break
       else

              if Is deadlock or is time ≥ maxtimeout then
                     increase the depth
                     pick next solution
              else
                     Get valid moves for Sokoban
                     foreach move do
                            Find next state
                            Put it in stack   
return path
